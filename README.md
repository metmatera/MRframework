# MRframework

_Work in progress_

Only the first time:
- Move to the local folder where you want to download the entire project (e.g., _cd Desktop/github_)
- _git clone https://github.com/metmatera/MRframework.git_

Steps to be always up-to-date (you have to be _git_ installed):
- Check always the status of the repository with che command _*git status*_. If the _tree_ is not clean, probably you have to _pull_ or _push_ some files.
- _git pull_ (to make your local repository up-to-date _w.r.t._ the GitHub repository)
- After modifying your local repository you will need to update the Github repository following the next steps
- _git add ._
- _git commit -m "msg"_, where _msg_ is a small text to describe your commit
- _git push_
